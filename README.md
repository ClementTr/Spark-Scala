## Spark-Scala

Spark-Scala: Telecom ParisTech - Specialized Master in Big Data/Data Science
<br>

### How does it work ?

<b>Spark in Scala TP.</b> <br>
In this repository there is pdf files showing how to setup your spark environment and how to begin with scala data science programing.<br>
<b>TP0</b> introduces basics of Spark and Scala<br>
<b>TP1</b> is based on data cleaning<br>
<b>TP3</b> is the last TP where some learning machine algorithms are implemented with Spark/Scala<br>
<br>
Please note that a build_and_submit.sh program has been done in order to facilitate the way to output our code. Once your path_to_spark will be adapted to your computer in this file (mine is '/usr/local/spark' and alllows me to run 'spark-shell' from everywhere in my computer), please just run:
```
./build_and_submit.sh Preprocessor
```
